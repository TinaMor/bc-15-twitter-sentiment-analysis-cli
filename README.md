Twitter is a popular online news and social networking service where registered users can share and interact with short SMS-like messages called "tweets" restricted to 140 characters, and unregistered can only read them. Users share thoughts, links and pictures on Twitter, journalists comment on live events, companies promote products and engage with customers. Each day millions of people tweet to express their opinions across any topic imaginable. This data source is valuable for both research and business. Analysis conducted on the data can show the reaction of people towards products or services, and can also be used for trend analysis. Twitter provides a very rich REST API for querying the system, accessing data, and controling your account.
